# Quarter-4-Project
This is the project we are making in Intro to Comp Sci 2024.
My idea is to learn the basics of machine learning using online courses, do the basic iris flower classification and learn what the code does and then create my own type of classification based off of the iris flower code. 

### Project Schedule

Week 1: Continue working on Kaggle Course, 80% done (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)  
Week 1.5 (May 1): Finish the Kaggle Course, 100% done  
Week 2 (May 3): Google Machine Learning Course, https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro  
Week 3 (tentative, might move it down one week to finish google course): Begin Iris Flower Classification (understanding the code, googling explanations), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjiACt2Cdjo, https://www.kaggle.com/code/ammarnassanalhajali/4-classifying-iris-species-course-1  
Week 4: Finish Iris Flower Classification   
Week 5: Start my own classification, maybe different color roses, some other flower or maybe baked goods (tbd chocolate croissants vs regular???)  
Week 6: Finish my own classification code (doesn't have to be too complicated)  



### Progress

Day 1: 19% of Kaggle Course (Link to my notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bUflBKO5QvhsDQULDkfeq00q8CpCFf4D8CQJmOcrnEA/edit)
Day 2: Finished scheduling and finding courses, 31% done with Kaggle course  
Day 3: 46% done with Kaggle (finished first model with step by step)  
Day 4: 62% done with Kaggle (learned about validation data and validating our last model with a splitting data technique)  
Day 5: 92% done with Kaggle (Am up to a competition submission but I may not do that)  
Day 6 (April 29): Done with Kaggle, Descending into ML mod of Google Crash Course on section called Linear Regression  
Day 7 (April 30): Finished last mod and began a new one "Reducing Loss" on the section called Gradient Descent. Learning about square loss models and descent's  
Day 8 (May 2): Can't do the playground exercises because it's blocked on chrome (maybe do it at home?). Also won't let me do Tenserflow exercises. Got to Generalization. video lecture. Might have to do a slight shift of plans if the course continues to be blocked and I can't do exercises.    
Day 9 (May 3): Finished Generalization, Training and Test Sets , Validation Sets and started with Representation. Learned about why we use validation sets and the intricacies of ML that causes us to avoid overfitting and using the partitioning of data. Beginning to question plan of finishing whole course or ending with my own project.    
Day 10 (May 6): Started working on Quarter 4 presentation. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gQpS_d_5tA3JY_4x3KDbntK6-FT3SwdBFWv9UUi-Tp8/edit#slide=id.gcc7554a049_0_392
