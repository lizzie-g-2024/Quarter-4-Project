# Quarter-4-Project
This is the project we are making in Intro to Comp Sci 2024.
My idea is to learn the basics of machine learning using online courses, do the basic iris flower classification and learn what the code does and then create my own type of classification based off of the iris flower code. 

### Project Schedule

Week 1: Continue working on Kaggle Course, 80% done (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)  
Week 1.5 (May 1): Finish the Kaggle Course, 100% done  
Week 2 (May 3): Google Machine Learning Course, https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro  
Week 3 (tentative, might move it down one week to finish google course): Begin Iris Flower Classification (understanding the code, googling explanations), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjiACt2Cdjo, https://www.kaggle.com/code/ammarnassanalhajali/4-classifying-iris-species-course-1  
Week 4: Finish Iris Flower Classification   
Week 5: Start my own classification, maybe different color roses, some other flower or maybe baked goods (tbd chocolate croissants vs regular???)  
Week 6: Finish my own classification code (doesn't have to be too complicated)  



### Progress

Day 1: 19% of Kaggle Course (Link to my notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bUflBKO5QvhsDQULDkfeq00q8CpCFf4D8CQJmOcrnEA/edit)
Day 2: Finished scheduling and finding courses, 31% done with Kaggle course  
Day 3: 46% done with Kaggle (finished first model with step by step)  
Day 4: 62% done with Kaggle (learned about validation data and validating our last model with a splitting data technique)  
Day 5: 92% done with Kaggle (Am up to a competition submission but I may not do that)  
Day 6 (April 29): Done with Kaggle, Descending into ML mod of Google Crash Course on section called Linear Regression  
Day 7 (April 30): Finished last mod and began a new one "Reducing Loss" on the section called Gradient Descent. Learning about square loss models and descent's  
Day 8 (May 2): Can't do the playground exercises because it's blocked on chrome (maybe do it at home?). Also won't let me do Tenserflow exercises. Got to Generalization. video lecture. Might have to do a slight shift of plans if the course continues to be blocked and I can't do exercises.    
Day 9 (May 3): Finished Generalization, Training and Test Sets , Validation Sets and started with Representation. Learned about why we use validation sets and the intricacies of ML that causes us to avoid overfitting and using the partitioning of data. Beginning to question plan of finishing whole course or ending with my own project.    
Day 10 (May 6): Started working on Quarter 4 presentation. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gQpS_d_5tA3JY_4x3KDbntK6-FT3SwdBFWv9UUi-Tp8/edit#slide=id.gcc7554a049_0_392  
Day 11 (May 7): Continued and finished working on Quarter 4 Presentation. Got up to Feature Engineering  
Day 12 (May 8): Polished Q4 Project. Almost finished Representation Unit and am on Cleaning Data portion  
Day 13 (May 9): Finished Representation and Feature Crossing. Am on Regularization:Simplicity and on Lambda.  
Day 14  (May 13): Finished Regularization, Logistic Regression, and am on Classification section "Accuracy". Also completed survey on Comp-Sci class.  
Day 15 (May 14): Finished Classification Accuracy and continued with Precision and Recall    
Day 16 (May 15): Finished Classification and am on Regularization:Sparcity, L1 Regularization 
Day 17 (May 16): Finished Regularization: Sparcity and am on Neural Networks, Structure  
Day 18 (May 17): Finished Neural Networks and Training Neural Networks. I am on Multi-Class Neural Networks, One vs All.   
Day 19 (May 20): Finished Multi-Class Neural Networks and am on Embeddings    
Day 20 (May 24): Finished Embeddings, the Entire ML concepts section of the course, ML Engineering, and am going to watch a video on Cancer Prediction using ML
